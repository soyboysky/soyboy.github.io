		My BIFL backpack of choice is the <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/collections/last-call/products/everyday-backpack-v1?variant=9783969284140">Peak Design V1 Everyday 30L Backpack</a>. I have owned this 3 times as long as I have any other backpack in my life, and I will enthusiastically reccommend it to everyone. I have also purchased the Messanger Bag from this same company, but I reccommend the BackPack much more.
	</p>
	<p>
		 In any carrying case I may use, have different "essential carry sets" for different circumstances, and also have the true EDC that I carry with me regardless of desitnation.

		<h3 id="edc" onclick="showEdc()" class="c">TRUE EDC</h3>
			
			<div id=edcHid style="display: none;">
				<p>My everyday carry and essentials are as follows:
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Cubix-Easy-Open-Mini-Pen-Case-Black/pd/13181">CUBIX small pencil case</a>, with varying pens and markers, sometimes with a pencil</li>
						<li><a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Vanishing-Point-Fountain-Pen-Black-Matte-Extra-Fine-Nib/pd/12163">Pilot Vanishing Point F Fountain Pen</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TRAVELER-S-COMPANY-TRAVELER-S-notebook-Starter-Kit-Regular-Size-Brown-Leather/pd/13623">Traveler's Journal</a> with varying inserts</li>
						<li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/SanDisk-Ultra-Dual-Type-C-SDDDC2-064G-G46/dp/B01EZ0X3L8?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duc12-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01EZ0X3L8">SanDisk USB Type-C Flashdrive</a></li>
						<li>iPhone 8S with <a href="https://pelacase.com/products/honey-bee-edition-eco-friendly-iphone-plus-case?variant=19541601353816">Honeybee Pela Case</a></li>
						<li>iPad 2018 Pro 10.9in display with <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU8G2LL/A/smart-keyboard-folio-for-11-inch-ipad-pro-us-english?fnode=9a">Smart Keyboard Folio</a></li>
						<li>Macbook Pro 2017 15 inch with Touch Bar</li>
					</ul>
				These items work together to allow flexibility in use. I can take my backpack with me to travel, or i can take it on a simple day stroll, and it can carry everything else needed for either excursion, in addition to the usual EDC.</p>

		<h3 id="phone" onclick="showPhone()" class="c">PHONE</h3>
			
			<div id=phoneHid style="display: none;">
				<!-- add gif off to right side of text with different screens of my phone screen (fake ofc)-->
				<p> My phone is a space of communication and entertainment. Often, just a place to scroll through cat videos and watch/listen to reddit stories. I will occasionally provide updates as to what my favorite apps on my phone are here.</p>
				<p class="indent">Current list of Favorite Apps:</p>
				<p class="indent"><a href="https://www.polarr.co/">Polarr</a>. A photo editing app that provides advanced tools for color correction and high quality special effects on photos, like fringing and grain.</p>	
			</div>
		
		<h3 id="comp" onclick="showComp()" class="c">COMPUTER</h3>
		
			<div id=compHid style="display: none;">
				<!-- 
				add photo of laptop on wood surface, polarized
				-->
				<p>My computer is a very special one. She's been through two screen replacements and many many hours of gaming, frantic essay writing, and staring blankly at netflix shows.</P>
				<p>All that aside, She's a very powerful machine; premiere pro runs pretty well with only minor hiccups, I can play most games (even minecraft) with normal FPS, and browsing is a breeze with the right WiFi netowrk. Because of the newest release of the Macbook Pro 16" (which is a BEAST of a machine, btw), I will link to <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP756?locale=en_US">this page of Apple's Support service</a> instead of the normal Apple website to show the super technical specifics, if one may be so interested.</P>
				<p>I Use a couple key apps on my laptop, including but not limited to:</p>
				<p class="indent">
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://avanier.now.sh/wiki/log.html"><b>Log</b></a> by Josh Avanier, a time-tracking logger</li>
						<li>Ulysses, a minimalistic writing app</li>
						<li>Spotify, for music and podcasts</li>
						<li>AutoDesk Fusion 360, for times when I feel inspired to CAD</li>
						<li>SubEthaEdit, to edit my Markup</li>
					</ul>

		<h3 id="ipad" onclick="showIpad()" class="c">IPAD PRO</h3>
			
			<div id=ipadHid style="display: none;">
				<p>I purchased this item, unlike the others, entirely on my own, so I am a rather proud iPad owner. I use it in junction with the Apple pencil to take most of my school notes digitally. I do this for many reasons, but the main two are ease of access, and environmentally friendly.</p>
				<p>This electronic is entirely productive. I have a couple unnecessary apps, like Youtube, Netflix, and different drawing apps, which I try to restrict my time on if I have not accomplished everything i've set out to on any particular day. However, sometimes I will watch or listen to videos in junction to working on my computer, if the work is solely on that device. Here is a list of the main productive apps I have on this device.
					<ul>
						<li>Goodnotes 5, my saving-grace note-taking app</li>
						<li>OneDrive, along with various Microsoft and Google Apps</li>
						<li>DuckDuckGo, a secure moble browser.</li>
						<li>Wolfram Alpha and Desmos are two school-related calculation apps</li>
						<li>Procreate is my go-to digital drawing app. (i used it in my <a href="../NOTEBOOK/chem.html">chemistry spread</a>)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>I use my iPad often, and am working on optimizing productivity versus distraction time.</p>
