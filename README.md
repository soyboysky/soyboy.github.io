# soyboy.github.io AKA creativechaos 
Hello! My name is skyler reuben, and this is the repository for my website, CreativeChaos.me. 

In my website, you will find many different pages, of varying stages of completion and progress. Among the finished are notes for classes, style and finance logs, essays, and life guidelines, and among the unfinished are xcode projects, conlanguages, and interactive, java-incorperated to-do lists.

If a unique viewer happens upon my website and sees room for improvem ent in any aspect, whether a simple grammatical error or an entire redesign concept, please contact me or submit a pull request! I appreciate any feedback you have.
