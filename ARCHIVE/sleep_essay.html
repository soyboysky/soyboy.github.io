<p>Sleep is an interesting thing. Obviously a necessity, yet also a burden.  </p>
<p><img src="IMG_0129.PNG" align=right> The time that could be spent working on projects, or preparing for the next day, is spent  in an unrelenting stiffness until your body deems it okay to end this. As this is a personal essay, with no constraints on the form or subject or syntax, I will express my truthful opinion: I dislike sleep. There are times where I will purposefully, with my body begging to rest, avoid it in hopes of the extra few hours of <i>something</i>. When I choose rest as an escape of my responsibilities, I feel guilty. When all I want to do is sleep, and feel like the idea is appealing, I recognize the escapism associated with taking this route. Although I can never avoid it, and I can never refuse it,  I can regulate it.</p>
<p>The first way I plan to do this is with lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming, for those who do not know, is the ability to know when you are dreaming, and control the reality within your subconsious during sleep.  As stated from <a href="http://world-of-lucid-dreaming.com">world-of-lucid-dreaming.com</a>, “It transforms your inner dream world into a living alternate reality - where everything you see, hear, feel, taste and even smell is as authentic as real life.” Basically, it can transport you to another dimension, where your mind is the creator, and you are aware of it all. When you are in a world where you can have unrestricted feeling of anything you can possibly imagine, you can do some amazing things. If I was able to visualize and execute exactly what I want a game to look like, even if I don’t even know how to code it yet, I could plan exactly how I would want it to look when I <i>do</i> know how to code it. I could also use this to plan how I want my day to look - say I had a complex schedule of commitments, I would have hours and hours to plan exactly what and how I wanted to travel, what homework I’d do and when, and even to get the un-productive time out of the way. I could just <i>have fun</i>, and (because my brain is weird and I need basically an equal amount of unproductive with the productive time)  I wouldn’t feel guilty about any of it, because I would be able to spend all my waking hours being productive. Now, I know how hard this will be, learning how to lucid dream. Theres a very lengthy process, that I will hope to start soon and I will detail in the intro to my Dream Journal. However, it is not the only way I plan/hope to regulate my sleep. This is only the regulation <i>while</i> sleeping.</p>
<p>The second way I plan to regulate my sleep is with a strict sleeping regimen. However, there are a few problems I’ve found with this idea:</p>
<p>1, I am very bad at regulating myself, no matter how much I want it or not. So obviously, I will have to take a different route than just  cold-turkey starting any routine I plan.  2, my work schedule is not static, meaning sometimes I may work at 5 in the morning and other times at 11 at night. A lot of the time, what people tell you is the best sleep schedule is to always sleep and wake up at the exact same time, every day, every weekend, to the hour. Since that is definitely not an option for me, I need to completely redefine the best sleep schedule for me and me alone. As of right now (and this will definitely change), This will be the schedule I will start to slowly integrate into my life:</p>
<br>
<h4>BEFORE SLEEP</h4>
<ul><li>30 minutes- an hour before I plan to sleep, <b>stay off of electronics</b>. This is to ensure that my body feels ready to sleep, instead of being woken up again by a bright screen. 
</li><li>take my 2 melatonin gummies, and drink 8 ounces of chamomile tea. Make sure that this is <b>at least 30 minutes before I go to bed</b>, as to ensure that the effects kick in as soon as I sleep.
</li><li>lay down 10 minutes before scheduled sleep time, and <b>journal about your day</b>. ALWAYS do this in a physical journal, separate from my dream journal, and write whatever comes to mind. 
</li><li>Once done journaling, <b>turn off ALL distractions</b> and go to sleep. This includes lights, videos, audio, everything.
</li></ul>

<h4>DURING SLEEP</h4>
<ul><li>If I wake up before alarm goes off, do not check the time, do NOT get on my phone. If this was because a dream, follow the <b>dream journal</b> process linked.
</li></ul>
<h4>AFTER SLEEP</h4>
<ul><li>As soon as alarm goes off, <b>DO. NOT. SNOOZE.</b> I repeat, DO. NOT. SNOOZE. And as well, DO NOT CLOSE YOUR EYES AGAIN. You WILL go to sleep again, no matter how much you think youre just “closing your eyes fro a few minutes”. 
</li><li>Instead of sleeping, think of and <b>remember your dreams. Write them down.</b> Find your dream journal under your pillow and write them down as soon as you awake. This is part of the process of learning how to lucid dream.
</li><li>After writing, immediately <b>stand up and walk around.</b> This is so that I will jumpstart the blood flow and waking up my brain. 
</li><li>At this point, if you haven’t already, <b>check your phone.</b> Even though some sources say you shouldn’t check your phone in the mornings either, I know that this will wake me up, so I should do it.
</li><li><b>Do your skincare routine or shower.</b> If I shower, make it a <b>cold shower.</b> Cold showers have many benefits, the main one being basically that walking into that shower it one of the initial worst, then best feelings in the world. It’ll be another thing to invigorate and energize me in the groggy, 6am mornings.
</li><li><b>Make your breakfast</b>, which includes <b>caffeinated tea</b>. Eventually I hope to wean myself off of caffeine, however, working at Starbucks now, this will be a challenge that I will take on at another point In time.
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>And, to restate the main point of this paragraph, this will be a SLOW INTEGRATION into my life. I know I will fail if I force myself to cold-turkey this schedule, but I believe that I will succeed if implement, say, one or tow of these steps at a time until I master those specific steps. </p>
<p>As you may see, the steps I list have no dependancies on time. This is because I plan to create the list for times as the days pass. Some days, like now as of writing this that I am on a break from school, I can sleep for several more hours than usual and not feel guilty. In that case, I would say I should sleep at 12 and wake up around 9. In the case where, in a few days, I will be working at 6:15am for three days straight, I should sleep around 10 and wake up around 4:30 or 5. And during school, I should wake up around 5:30 and go to sleep around 11. It is all variable, because time is not static, and I should not force it to be so. </p>
<p>The last thing I will do, now that I have created a sleeping schedule it think about the week ahead of me, and create the sleeping times for each day. This way, I plan ahead, I know exactly what to do, and I don’t have to worry about the schedule until the planned sleep time. And as I made the schedule flexible, I am free to start preparing for be 30 minutes until sleep, or an hour and a half before, all depending on the time. </p>
<p>I hope that by sharing this, I have helped some readers discover a practice that may work for them. Obviously, not everything will work for you as I hope/know this will for me. I wrote this for myself, to gather my thoughts, opinions, practices, and judgements into one collective piece. I hope you have enjoyed.</p>
