			 Design a 3-dimensional product to sit on a table or hang from a string. It must be able to ship flat to markets overseas.  You will design the 3D object in CAD, then laser cut the flat pieces out of cardboard for assembly.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Constraints:</b><br>
			<ul>
				<li>The final object must be 3-Dimensional assembled from laser-cut cardboard pieces
				<li>The final product must be comprised of at least 4 laser cut pieces.
				<li>Cutting area can be no larger than 8.5” x 11”
				<li>Cardboard MUST be brought from home.
				<li>Cardboard may be no thicker than ¼”
				<li>Each student will be allowed only one trial cut (if needed) on the laser before cutting their final product.
			</ul>

			<h3>Why is it important to have a flat-shippable product?</h3>

			<p>It is important to have a flat, shippable product in any business. When shipping in masses and individually, volume is a big concern. Weight is not an issue, but the space that things take up in crates is; if a shipping company creates a product that has to be tetris-ed into crates to fit a substantial amount, it will cost more per product to the customer and the business. </p>
			
			<p>However, in a product that takes up a 8.5X11X3 inch footprint, which is easily stackable (take, for instance, printer paper), then you can ship thousands of the product on just one ship or airplane. This saves time, cuts costs on both ends, and increases productivity. </p>
			
			<h3>What primary sources did you contact, and what did they tell you that can help with this project?</h3>
			
			<p>During my visit to TPG Architecture, I talked with many architects and interior designers. Many of them suggested that their designs and materials chosen for any particular client is strongly dictated, especially projects outside of the Metropolitan NYC Area, by the transportation available, or the transportation budget. It may be decided to use some sort of plastic or rubber instead of concrete or wood, even if the latter better suits aesthetic, because transporting hundreds of tons of hardwood is not efficient. </p>
			
			<p>This helps in my project to understand the importance of shipping packages, and they showed images to help visualize how they transport materials on to the site. </p>
			
			<h3>What secondary sources did you find, and what information did this give you that can help with this project?</h3>
			
			<p>For my secondary source, I don’t have <em>one</em> specifically. Rather, I searched up cardboard, flat-to-3D objects and examined how they fit together, if I could. This was really helpful in a multitude of ways, as it showed me how different types of these models can fit together (either by notches, glue, Tetris pieces, etc). It gave me a couple of ideas for how I could make my house design work.</p>
			
			<h3>What existing solutions did you find? What aspects of these designs will you use in your design?</h3>
			
			<p>As stated in the previous section, there are many different existing solutions for a cardboard cutout design. One that I may go with is the slot fitted design, where each cross-section has a small section cut out of them, one on the bottom and one on the top, which is fitted together.</p>

				<p>I know that I will have a successful deisgn when I can look at the design and undertstand exactly what goes where and how. This is my main factor for deciding if my design is successful but I will also judge based off of:
					<ul>
						<li>Tolerance dependance. If my deisgn needs to be extremely accurate to work, it gets a lower grade.</li>
						<li>Aesthetic of finished design. I want my design to look like a real house when created, so if it looks rought and choppy, points off.</li>
						<li>Efficiency of production. If it will take years to put together, points off. I obviously don't expect to have a 1 minute production process, but the quicker the better.</lI>
					</ul>
				This is an image of my final design plan. It is not completely accurate nor dimensioned yet, I have not played around in fusion enough. I will produced this soon.

					From the design shown in the video, we made a couple modifications. To start, we put the windshield on last, and put the wheels and tires on each piece of the body separately. After that, then we assembled the pieces together, followed by the windshield.

				<p>
					<h3>How did you test your solution?</h3>
					We tested our solution by running through the designated process multiple times, for each improvement proposed, to see if it improved the speed and/or efficiency. We would only make decisions based of efficiency/understanding alone if and only if it had no effect on the speed. and change in the  average speed and we did not go through with it.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>What data did you collect?</h3>
					Sadly, we practiced on a whiteboard table and recorded our times there, forgetting to take pictures. This is something we would improve in the future, and make a physical or digital table to record all of our trial times for the improvements. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>How well does your solution met the needs of the client/consumer?</h3>
					I think that the assembly line process we created, with only two people, is very efficient. Since most groups had three, they had an extra brain that could focus solely on one task. Our group of two had to have one person focus on the disassembly and reassembly, and another person could focus on wheels. Since disassembly and reassembly are two very different processes, it was harder to remember. Because of that, i think that our two-person-group's time is very good, and would please the client and or consumer with its efficiency and ease of understanding (and, the process of slamming the tires onto the axle is quite fun).
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>If you had 2 more days to work on the project, what would you change?</h3>
					If we had two more days of work on this project, I would have spent it practicing and improving the design further. On Friday, I found a more efficient way to put the two body parts with wheels on to the main frame, which would eliminate confusion on Person 1's end. However, it would have taken a couple days to re-learn the process, and we just didn't have that time, so we couldn't use this proven to work improvement. I would spend the extra days practicing that process.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>How will your solution affect your client/target audience?</h3>
					They will be very pleased to see we can efficiently do the process, with only two people, in less than 1/3 of the required time. It would improve their overall efficiency.
