	 	<p>Design a 3-dimensional product to sit on a table or hang from a string. It must be able to ship flat to markets overseas.  You will design the 3D object in CAD, then laser cut the flat pieces out of cardboard for assembly.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Constraints:</b><br>
			<ul>
				<li>The final object must be 3-Dimensional assembled from laser-cut cardboard pieces
				<li>The final product must be comprised of at least 4 laser cut pieces.
				<li>Cutting area can be no larger than 8.5” x 11”
				<li>Cardboard MUST be brought from home.
				<li>Cardboard may be no thicker than ¼”
				<li>Each student will be allowed only one trial cut (if needed) on the laser before cutting their final product.

			<h3>Why is it important to have a flat-shippable product?</h3>

			<p>It is important to have a flat, shippable product in any business. When shipping in masses and individually, volume is a big concern. Weight is not an issue, but the space that things take up in crates is; if a shipping company creates a product that has to be tetris-ed into crates to fit a substantial amount, it will cost more per product to the customer and the business. </p>
			
			<p>However, in a product that takes up a 8.5X11X3 inch footprint, which is easily stackable (take, for instance, printer paper), then you can ship thousands of the product on just one ship or airplane. This saves time, cuts costs on both ends, and increases productivity. </p>
			
			<h3>What primary sources did you contact, and what did they tell you that can help with this project?</h3>
			
			<p>During my visit to TPG Architecture, I talked with many architects and interior designers. Many of them suggested that their designs and materials chosen for any particular client is strongly dictated, especially projects outside of the Metropolitan NYC Area, by the transportation available, or the transportation budget. It may be decided to use some sort of plastic or rubber instead of concrete or wood, even if the latter better suits aesthetic, because transporting hundreds of tons of hardwood is not efficient. </p>
			
			<p>This helps in my project to understand the importance of shipping packages, and they showed images to help visualize how they transport materials on to the site. </p>
			
			<h3>What secondary sources did you find, and what information did this give you that can help with this project?</h3>
			
			<p>For my secondary source, I don’t have <em>one</em> specifically. Rather, I searched up cardboard, flat-to-3D objects and examined how they fit together, if I could. This was really helpful in a multitude of ways, as it showed me how different types of these models can fit together (either by notches, glue, Tetris pieces, etc). It gave me a couple of ideas for how I could make my house design work.</p>
			
			<h3>What existing solutions did you find? What aspects of these designs will you use in your design?</h3>
			
			<p>As stated in the previous section, there are many different existing solutions for a cardboard cutout design. One that I may go with is the slot fitted design, where each cross-section has a small section cut out of them, one on the bottom and one on the top, which is fitted together.</p>

				<p>I know that I will have a successful deisgn when I can look at the design and undertstand exactly what goes where and how. This is my main factor for deciding if my design is successful but I will also judge based off of:
					<ul>
						<li>Tolerance dependance. If my deisgn needs to be extremely accurate to work, it gets a lower grade.</li>
						<li>Aesthetic of finished design. I want my design to look like a real house when created, so if it looks rought and choppy, points off.</li>
						<li>Efficiency of production. If it will take years to put together, points off. I obviously don't expect to have a 1 minute production process, but the quicker the better.</lI>
					</ul>
				This is an image of my final design plan. It is not completely accurate nor dimensioned yet, I have not played around in fusion enough. I will produced this soon.

				<p><h3> What was your plan for completing this task in the required time?</h3>
				
				<p>My plan for completing this in required time was to have my house fully lazered out before we went on christmas break. Unfortunately, I continuously forgot to bring cardboard (and was also unaware of any cardboard storage downstairs). Therefore, the draft cut was not done until Monday we got back from break.
				</p>
				<h3>Modifications on a Timeline</h3>
				<p>In my initial "final design", I assumed the engraving process of the lazer cutter would cut a little deeps, or at least wider, than it did. For each wall, the engraving was supposed to allow it to fold inand create the corners of the walls, This did not happen and hindered the design. I had to gentely cut along every single engraved line just to make it move at all. I had to, essentially, completely redesign my house for it to reach my aesthetic and practicality standards.
				</p><p>I was trying to not use any glue in this project, but since the engraving was such an epic failure, I caved.

					I redesigned my house to be of the same dimensions, but a little simpler (see Criterion B for my initial, "final design"). While still adhering to the >4 pieces rule and fitting within a letter sized-sheet of cardboard, I managed to create a designed that, in theory, coud be made to have very minimal glue appearence.
				</p><p>With this, I finally had a working, practical, and aesthetically appealing design for this house. An Ant-sized cardboard house.
