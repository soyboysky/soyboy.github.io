			<h3>Why is it important to have a fast and effective assembly process?</h3>
			<p>
				An assembly line is one of, if not the most important process in the production of a product to get as much of your product out there as possible, using everyone’s time efficiently, 
			</p>
			<h3>What primary sources did you contact, and what did they tell you?</h3>
			<p>
				<b>What are your responsibilities in the manufacturing world?</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="p1">I guide people in the use of robot and collaborative robots, and autonomous mobile robots.   I make sure they operate safely by the rules, and help our vendors make advancements in technology that is consistent with the way we do things at Ford and the safety rules.  I develop new technology that is feasible and of value (hopefully).</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>What in your opinion is the key to keeping an assembly line or assembly process fast?</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="p1">Keeping things simple for the people.  Adding automation to do things people are not good at such as metrology, inspections (manual inspection only 80% effective), process measurements like torque flow rate, leak rate… </span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>How do you work together with your peers to be the most efficient with your time at work? AKA, how do you communicate and determine who does what?</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="p1">Knowing your teams’ strengths and weaknesses is key.  Giving the vision tech spec room to do his job, while I do the robot part… we have developed an efficient method of working over the years.   Effective work teams cannot be created instantly, it takes time.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>What secondary sources did you find, and what information did they give you?</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>What are your responsibilities in the manufacturing world?</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="p2">My official responsibilities are as follows:<br>Act as SME (subject matter expert) to other engineering teams (VOME, PTME, IT, etc.) on matters relating to Industrial Controls Software, IIOT and Cyber Security.<br>Maintain a current library of all  international regulatory standards that effect Manufacturing Controls systems.<br>Provide technical input to AME Forums to assess new manufacturing technologies for environmental and machine performance.<br>Lead advanced technology projects in the Advanced Manufacturing portfolio.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>What in your opinion is the key to keeping an assembly line or assembly process fast?</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="p2">Eliminating uncertainty and variability. I was once told, how comfortable would it be if someone rearranged your kitchen cabinets on a daily basis? When you reached for a water glass and the plates were there instead. Would that uncertainty and variability impact your speed to getting a glass of water?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>How do you work together with your peers to be the most efficient with your time at work? AKA, how do you communicate and determine who does what?</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="p2">Electronic communication is sufficient for generalized communication (questions/answers to specific statements).<br>However, the majority of human communication is non-verbal.Understanding which communication method is appropriate per situation is key.<br>More importantly, understanding which method is also most appropriate per individual/situation, is essential.Unfortunately, there is no simple rulebook/textbook for this. It takes time working with your peers to find the most efficient method which works for the team.</span>

					This animated gif is the final design assembly process for our group. First, when taking apart the body, we take apart the body sections and windshield. Then, remove all the wheels, and the tires associated. This is the last step in the disassembly because it is the most time-consuming.
					<br>The goal time to beat is 17 seconds, but i would be content with under 22.
					<br>I know that I will have a successful assembly process when I can easily dis/assemble the car with ease and agility.
				</p>
				<p>
					My initial 2 designs were easy to understand, but a waste of everyone's time and not very fast. 
					<ul>
						<li>Design 1: One person does everything, chaotically. Take everything apart and reassemble in the most efficient way they see fit, but without an exact way to do this. This design left room for error and stalled thought and was therefore bypassed. 
						<li>Design 2: One person takes the wheels, in their entirety, off of the axles, then takes the rubber off. Then person 2 then takes apart the body, and after removing the windshield, immediately puts that back on and starts that reassembly process. Person 1 then puts the wheels back together, and puts them on the axles as they are assembled, if possible. This design was very complex, having many switches back and forth, and did not use the most efficient method for assembling the wheels that it could have.
					</ul>
					<br>I looked over the potential in these designs, and their flaws, and from that produced what is now our final design. 
					<br>Design 3: one person removes the windshield and the body parts from each other. They keep the middle body piece and the windshield next to themselves, while the two end parts are given to the second person. The second person, as quickly as possible, removes the wheels from the pieces and then removes the rubbers, carefully placing each wheel upside-down.
					<br>Once all is disassembled, the second person takes hold of the body parts, and slams the axle into the wheel, connecting the wheel to the axle, and then lifts it up and repeats the process with a tire, which makes one full wheel on an axle. This process is repeated 4 times, and once one end piece is complete, they will lay it the correct way (how the car would drive) on the table. Once both pieces are assembled fully, person one takes control of both of those pieces, and, assuming that they were placed on the table the correct way, they can wheel both pieces over to the main body part and insert both into either side of the main piece simultaneously. After that, person one finished off by placing the windshield on. 
					<br>Granted, this design is complicated, however, with a little practice, it comes naturally and is, frankly, quite fun. It was also very fast, safe, and an efficient use of everyone's time.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>DECISION MATRIX</h4>
					We ranked our designs based on 5 factors:
					<ol>
						<li>Understanding - Can everyone read and follow our design, and know what each person needs to do?
						<li>Speed - Out of a couple trials, which design is the fastest?
						<li>Complexity - Is it difficult to remember what to do under pressure?
						<li>Safety - Does it pose any risk of injury, to either the car or ourselves?
						<li>Efficient Use of Time - Does one person just stand around and do nothing, or is everyone as active as they need to be to be efficient?
					</ol>

				<p>
					From the design shown in the video, we made a couple modifications. To start, we put the windshield on last, and put the wheels and tires on each piece of the body separately. After that, then we assembled the pieces together, followed by the windshield.

		<br>
			
			<div id="critD" style="display:none;">
				
				<p>
					<h3>How did you test your solution?</h3>
					We tested our solution by running through the designated process multiple times, for each improvement proposed, to see if it improved the speed and/or efficiency. We would only make decisions based of efficiency/understanding alone if and only if it had no effect on the speed. and change in the  average speed and we did not go through with it.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>What data did you collect?</h3>
					Sadly, we practiced on a whiteboard table and recorded our times there, forgetting to take pictures. This is something we would improve in the future, and make a physical or digital table to record all of our trial times for the improvements. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>How well does your solution met the needs of the client/consumer?</h3>
					I think that the assembly line process we created, with only two people, is very efficient. Since most groups had three, they had an extra brain that could focus solely on one task. Our group of two had to have one person focus on the disassembly and reassembly, and another person could focus on wheels. Since disassembly and reassembly are two very different processes, it was harder to remember. Because of that, i think that our two-person-group's time is very good, and would please the client and or consumer with its efficiency and ease of understanding (and, the process of slamming the tires onto the axle is quite fun).
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>If you had 2 more days to work on the project, what would you change?</h3>
					If we had two more days of work on this project, I would have spent it practicing and improving the design further. On Friday, I found a more efficient way to put the two body parts with wheels on to the main frame, which would eliminate confusion on Person 1's end. However, it would have taken a couple days to re-learn the process, and we just didn't have that time, so we couldn't use this proven to work improvement. I would spend the extra days practicing that process.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>How will your solution affect your client/target audience?</h3>
					They will be very pleased to see we can efficiently do the process, with only two people, in less than 1/3 of the required time. It would improve their overall efficiency.
