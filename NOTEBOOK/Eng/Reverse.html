	 	<p><strong>Task:</strong> Design a 3D printed part that can be attached to an existing product to enhance the product. Model both the existing product and the new attachment in Fusion.</p>

		<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li>The existing product must be approved by the teacher (get it approved before beginning Criterion A research). </li>
				<li>The existing product must be comprised of no fewer than 4 and no more than 10 pieces. </li>
				<li>Sculpt/Form must be used to create the attachment/enhancement part. </li>
				<li>The attachment/enhancement part can be no larger than 2” x 2” x 2”. </li>
				<li>The attachment/enhancement part will be 3D printed <strong>only 1 time</strong>. There will be no re-prints.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>What problems/issues does the existing product have?</h3>

			<p>The existing product is the new espresso machine at my place of work, the Mastrena ii. While certainly an upgrade in almost every way, the handle that pours out espresso is no longer mobile. The closer the espresso spout is to the desired cup, the more still the shot, which produces a beautiful crema and heart of the espresso. However, this immobile and high up espresso spout means that all size of cup, especially short ones, get very bubbly, agitated espresso shots, often flat. This means that they are not up to company standard, taste bad, and produce bad foam and latte art. </p>

			<h3>What primary sources did you contact, and what did they tell you that can help with this project? </h3>

			<p>My Primary source was Joey, a fourth-year engineering student who is very familiar with the problem i am trying to solve. He emphasizes how crucial it is to know your tolerances; what cups you are working with and how specific it has to be. Consider <em>all</em> circumstances your device may be used in and try to make it as compatible as possible. Also think about the mechanics it may have, and in such a messy environment, drainage and cleaning is important. </p>

			<h3>What secondary sources did you find, and what information did this give you that can help with this project?</h3>

			<p>Lots of sources such as <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/espresso4.htm" title="this one">this one</a> will tell you about the importance of the crema in terms of the quality of the beans you use to make espresso. Ideally, a medium- to light-roast, freshly roasted coffee will produced the fullest crema. Crema is considered the signature of a good espresso shot. Even if your beans and machine meet quality standard, the look and presence of the crema is what makes or breaks a good looking shot, and the drink that follows.</p>

			<p>In my research, tilting the cup slightly so that the single stream of espresso falls on an angle, this is the ideal method to preserving the flavor and body of the shot. </p>

			<h3>What existing solutions (enhancements) did you find? What aspects of these designs will you use in your design?</h3>

			<p>Currently, it seems there are no solutions to this problem on the Mastrena ii. While for me, a latte art nerd, the foam is a big issue, its not a top priority for other baristas. It is a privilege that I have the time and resources to dedicate to this project.</p>

				<p>I know that I will have a successful deisgn when I can look at the design and undertstand exactly what goes where and how. This is my main factor for deciding if my design is successful but I will also judge based off of:
					<ul>
						<li>Tolerance dependance. If my deisgn needs to be extremely accurate to work, it gets a lower grade.</li>
						<li>Aesthetic of finished design. I want my design to look like a real house when created, so if it looks rought and choppy, points off.</li>
						<li>Efficiency of production. If it will take years to put together, points off. I obviously don't expect to have a 1 minute production process, but the quicker the better.</li>
					</ul>
				This is an image of my final design plan. It is not completely accurate nor dimensioned yet, I have not played around in fusion enough. I will produced this soon.

				<p><h3> What was your plan for completing this task in the required time?</h3></p>
				
				<p>My plan for completing this in required time was to have my house fully lazered out before we went on christmas break. Unfortunately, I continuously forgot to bring cardboard (and was also unaware of any cardboard storage downstairs). Therefore, the draft cut was not done until Monday we got back from break.
				</p>
				<h3>Modifications on a Timeline</h3>
				<p>In my initial "final design", I assumed the engraving process of the lazer cutter would cut a little deeps, or at least wider, than it did. For each wall, the engraving was supposed to allow it to fold inand create the corners of the walls, This did not happen and hindered the design. I had to gentely cut along every single engraved line just to make it move at all. I had to, essentially, completely redesign my house for it to reach my aesthetic and practicality standards.
				</p><p>I was trying to not use any glue in this project, but since the engraving was such an epic failure, I caved.

					I redesigned my house to be of the same dimensions, but a little simpler (see Criterion B for my initial, "final design"). While still adhering to the more than 4 pieces rule and fitting within a letter sized-sheet of cardboard, I managed to create a designed that, in theory, coud be made to have very minimal glue appearence.
				</p><p>With this, I finally had a working, practical, and aesthetically appealing design for this house. An Ant-sized cardboard house.

				<h3>How did you test your solution?</h3>
				<p>As mentioned in the previous section, my initial design was faulty because of a miscommunication on how the printer does engravings. While I would like to believe that my initial design would have worked like a charm, I can never be certain.
				<br>
				The best that I can do is say that my inital design <i>was</i>, indeed, flat, but faulty, and would be very dissapointing if a kid recieved that as a present overseas :(.</p>
				<h3>What data did you collect?</h3>
				<p>In terms of data, it is mostly qualitative. The test cut was faulty, would not fold together, and had very obvious glue lines when I attempted to glue it together (no!).</p>
				<h3>How would you critically evaluate the performance of your final product?</h3>
				<p>Because of the very quick redesign that had to be done in order for my project to actually work, I have some retrospective critiques.</p>
				<p>Firstly, I know that I could have asked beforehand what the engraving process was like, and maybe seen how it effects cardboard, before basing my entire design off of a theoretical mechanism. </p>
					<br>
				Secondly, I would
Based on your data, how well do you think your solution met the needs of the client/consumer?
If you had 2 more days to work on the project, what would you change?
How will your solution affect your client/target audience?
