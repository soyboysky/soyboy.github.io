			<h3>What problems/issues does the existing product have?</h3>

			<p>The existing product is the new espresso machine at my place of work, the Mastrena ii. While certainly an upgrade in almost every way, the handle that pours out espresso is no longer mobile. The closer the espresso spout is to the desired cup, the more still the shot, which produces a beautiful crema and heart of the espresso. However, this immobile and high up espresso spout means that all size of cup, especially short ones, get very bubbly, agitated espresso shots, often flat. This means that they are not up to company standard, taste bad, and produce bad foam and latte art. </p>

			<h3>What primary sources did you contact, and what did they tell you that can help with this project? </h3>

			<p>My Primary source was Joey, a fourth-year engineering student who is very familiar with the problem i am trying to solve. He emphasizes how crucial it is to know your tolerances; what cups you are working with and how specific it has to be. Consider <em>all</em> circumstances your device may be used in and try to make it as compatible as possible. Also think about the mechanics it may have, and in such a messy environment, drainage and cleaning is important. </p>

			<h3>What secondary sources did you find, and what information did this give you that can help with this project?</h3>

			<p>Lots of sources such as <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/espresso4.htm" title="this one">this one</a> will tell you about the importance of the crema in terms of the quality of the beans you use to make espresso. Ideally, a medium- to light-roast, freshly roasted coffee will produced the fullest crema. Crema is considered the signature of a good espresso shot. Even if your beans and machine meet quality standard, the look and presence of the crema is what makes or breaks a good looking shot, and the drink that follows.</p>

			<p>In my research, tilting the cup slightly so that the single stream of espresso falls on an angle, this is the ideal method to preserving the flavor and body of the shot. </p>

			<h3>What existing solutions (enhancements) did you find? What aspects of these designs will you use in your design?</h3>

			<p>Currently, it seems there are no solutions to this problem on the Mastrena ii. While for me, a latte art nerd, the foam is a big issue, its not a top priority for other baristas. It is a privilege that I have the time and resources to dedicate to this project.</p>

			<h3>How will you know that you created a successful design (what are your criteria for success)?</h3>

<p>I know that I will have a successful design when it fits these criteria to the best of its ability:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The design is able to <strong>support a wide range of cup sizes</strong>, hot and cold cups, personal cups, etc. This is mostly theoretical guess and estimation in terms of ranking designs. </li>
	<li>The design fits neatly <strong>within the constraints</strong>. This is completely measurable by drawing a 2” x 2” x 2” box around the design and making sure it is completely inside. </li>
	<li>The design is <strong>aesthetically pleasing</strong> without compromising function. Mechanisms must work well and be visually appealing, mostly theoretical.</li>
	<li>The mechanisms are <strong>easy to assemble</strong> and will stay together. Measurable by count of parts, </li>
	<li>The entire design is <strong>easy to clean</strong>/cover with heat tape where applicable</li>
</ul>

<h3>Share 3 sketches of your initial design ideas.</h3>
<img src="imgs/Untitled_Artwork 7.png" alt="3 designs and final dimensioned sketch" width="100%">
<h3>Share a decision matrix that helped you choose your final design.</h3>
				<img src="imgs/decisionMatrixR.png" width="100%" alt="Decision Matrix">

<h3>How did you rank each idea on the decision matrix?</h3>

<p>With this decision matrix, I took care to reason out point deductions for each idea.</p>

<p>My first sketch, Iris, only really had aesthetic going for it. Other than that, the mechanism would take hours to assemble (many small parts), be difficult to clean, and not even have a chance of working with personal cups, mugs, or cold cups. It also definitely wouldn’t fit within the constraints. </p>

<p>My second idea, Twist (named after the twist-latch mechanism), has a form with an angled-cylinder cut-out in it, allowing for lots of flexibility in the types of cups that can be tilted. However, the assembly was the difficult part, I wasn’t sure if I would be able to 3D print a long-lasting, twisting latch mechanism. It also wasn’t flexible on where in the grills of the machine it could be placed, since it would have a fixed width. This caused a 3-point assembly dock, and 1 point on flexibility. </p>

<p>I liked the idea of the cylinder cut-out form for the cups, so I kept that consistent in what became my final design, called Clamp (do you see the pattern here?). Funnily enough, Clamps’ main selling point is that it uses springs to stay in place. This allowed for the flexibility of attachment, which earned it 5 points. Because the assembly is so easy as well, this means that it is easy to clean. </p>

				<h3>Modifications to your initial design?</h3>
				<p>I didnt really make any changes to the pictured sketch with dimensions on it. That's mostly due to the fact that to create a dimensioned final design properly, i had to mess around with it in fusion, which resulted in finding the proper dimensions before actually completing the part. If any changed were made, it was messing around with the form, the angle, and overall shape of the "body", as I call it.

				<h3>How did you test your solution?</h3>
				<p>This was my criteria for a successful design in Criterion B:</p>
					
				<table class="tableAdjust" width="100%">
					<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>The design is able to <strong>support a wide range of cup sizes</strong>, hot and cold cups, personal cups, etc. This is mostly theoretical guess and estimation in terms of ranking designs.
						</td>
						<td>
							Unfortunately, the size constraints restricted the amount of cup sizes any part could hold well. The surface can easily hold a short starbucks cup, but it is difficult to keep any cold cups or personal cups just as steady. I would say this was partially sucessful and i know how i could improve it in the future.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>The design fits neatly <strong>within the constraints</strong>. This is completely measurable by drawing a 2” x 2” x 2” box around the design and making sure it is completely inside.
						</td>
						<td>I did indeed make a system that fit within the constraints. This was completely measurable.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>The design is <strong>aesthetically pleasing</strong> without compromising function. Mechanisms must work well and be visually appealing, mostly theoretical.
						</td>
						<td>Personally, I think that this design was aesthetically pleasing for its size. Unfortunately, on the mechanism part, It didnot quite work. The tolerances were too tight, and the seperate 'legs' of the mechanism, where the spring would have gone, were too small, or printed not to scale. Even when i sanded everything down to as thin as i could get it, the legs were sticky and would not flow smoothly. Other than that, the place were the grills would go were too thin, and one of them snapped off during testing, I'm not quite sure if there would have been a way to fix this, since there is not much wiggle room allowed between the grills. 
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>The entire design is <strong>easy to clean</strong>/cover with heat tape where applicable
						</td>
						<td>This was completely achieved, although because it does not function I did not cover it with heat tape. 
						</td>
					</tr>
					</tbody>

				<h3>What data did you collect?</h3>
				<p>In terms of data, it is mostly qualitative. Did it fit together? partially, but not in the way I needed or wanted it to. Did it work with the spring-loaded mechanism? It was the right size and fit the way i needed it to, it would have, but no, it did not. could it withstand pressure? No, it brokw when trying to maneuver it onto the espresso bar grills. 
				</p>
				<h3>How would you critically evaluate the performance of your final product?</h3>
				<p>My product upon final print did not work according to my criteria. But thst is okay, i can see many improvements for the continuation of this product in the future.
				</p>
				<h3>Based on your data, how well do you think your solution met the needs of the client/consumer?</h3>
				<p>Well, it didn't work, so it would not meet any of the needs of the client/consumer.
				</p>
				<h3>If you had 2 more days to work on the project, what would you change?</h3>
				<p>I would increase my tolerances and try to thicken the fragile areas of the project to the best that I could.
