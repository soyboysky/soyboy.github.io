<p>This section of the notebook is dedicated to my english notes. Though plentiful in volume, I often don't look back on them, as the act of writing them is usually enough studying. I look through my digital notebook a lot thoug, so hopefully this new section will be as equally viewed as all else.</p>

	<h4 style="text-align:center;">ENGLISH SEMINAR NOTES: AMERICAN DREAM</h4>

<h5 style="text-align:center;">5 minute write</h5>

<p>I think that the concept itself exists; to Come from nothing or lack of safety or whatever reason, to America, gain experience and success through hardwork, start a family, get a visa, life a happy life after immigration. However, I think the American dream concept is an oversimplified though of even the simplist, &quot;real American dream&quot;. There leaves voids in the places of hardship that trying to achieve this goal really has, and ultimately makes something that is incredibly rare seem completely attainable. In this sense, I think that the conceptual slang is true, but the verb or noun is not.</p>

<h5 style="text-align:center;">Seminar notes</h5>

<ul>
<li>by the definition, it exists, but not as something that can be attained</li>
<li>The dream does exist but only based on what you beleive</li>
<li>It is ever-changing and adapts to what society's priorities are</li>
<li>Based on what your view of success is</li>
<li>Coined term at the time of the Chinese exclusion act so it varies based on opportunities</li>
<li>Not attainable anymore bc the view is poor to rich</li>
<li>Hana college cost point -</li>
<li>Money is not the only aspect - also called reaction and creating a new opportunity for other generations</li>
<li>1950's white picket fence family; everyone's success story is different and that may be their American dream; never one-size-fits-all</li>
<li>thinking of first-world problems - we are living in our own American dream</li>
<li>Success in Connors grandparents eyes was working as an accountant; complacent and comfortable living - proud of the life that you led</li>
<li>we don't have a good grasp on what it can actually apply to because we're in A2</li>
<li>Pay gap is the definition of anti American dream - working hard should pay equal, and America doesn't</li>
<li>The American dream is attainable but it requires a &quot;perfect cocktail mixture&quot; of Events</li>
<li>The American dream is sacrifice and has a lot of factors to it, like opportunity</li>
<li>the disagreement of what is the American dream comes from the different definitions</li>
<li>success is relative to what you want</li>
<li>It is a thing but it is not attainable right now, it's hard to even start</li>
<li>Helena doctor friend couple attain the American dream, back then it was easier but nowadays it's much harder</li>
<li>Again, moving for opportunities in the younger generations</li>
<li>The American dream message is to tell people to never give Up</li>
<li>thriving rather than surviving; it's all variable</li>
<li>Facing failure and moving forward</li>
</ul>
