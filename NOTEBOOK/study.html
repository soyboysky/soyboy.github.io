	<h1 style="text-align:center; letter-spacing: 0.5em;">A SELF-GUIDED STUDY</h1>
	</div>
<p>I've found that in order for me to be productive, I must have a very strict, set list of things in order, or else, for some unknowable reason, i'm not able to study.</p>

<br>

<div id="body">
<h3 style="text-align:center;" id="currenthabits">IDEAL TIME</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"> Time or day and relation to other events is a crucial part of productivity.<br>Directly after I get home, I should make something to eat. This is my time to relax, and get the unproductive out, so to leave room for the productive.
<br>
After this, there comes to be 2 options - I either stay at home working at a comfortable pace, or I go somewhere to study and work hard.

				<tr>
					<td class="linkcol3" style="text-align:center;">
						<b style="text-align: center;">AT HOME</b>
						<br><br>When I am at home, I tend to stack off if I don't set up a <b>strict regimen</b> of what I am supposed to do and how I am supposed to do it. I have prepared a page in the back of my new <a href="../../../ABOUT/inventory.html#bag">Rocketbook</a> notebook where, to my ideal to-do list format, can plan out exactly what I must do and how much time I have to do it.
						 <br><br>If I have too quiet of a natural workspace (I.e., a space with no ambient sound, no TV in the background I can barely hear, etc.), I tend to try and fill the void with sound, via Youtube or music. To work at the optimal level, I must find a location with a decent, but not distracting, <b>ambient noise</b> level.
						 <br><br> When I work from home, my focus is optimized if I take a minute before the study session to <b>acknowledge why I want to achieve an learn and understand</b>. If I take a minute of my time to acknowledge these reasons, I become much more motivated to work.
					</td>
					<td class="linkcol3" style="text-align:center;">
						<b style="text-align: center;">AWAY </b>
						<br><br>Often, when I study at a location different from my home, it is either because of 1 of 2 reasons: either out of convenience, or out of necessity. Having to wear a <a href="https://www.gc2b.co">binder</a> any time I go out, I often try to minimize the times I put it back on and instead extend the one time I do wear it, if that makes sense. Essentially, I would rather wear it for 12 hours straight from 7am-7pm than from 7am-2pm, 3pm-5pm, and 8pm-11pm. Therefore, if i know I have an event at 6 and get out of school at 2, I will study at a coffee shop for those 4 hours in between.
						<br><br>I have a few locations i default to, and a few places I plan to take advantage of more often. Some of those places include my local College study center ("the Dude"), Starbucks, Mighty Good Coffee, Local libraries associated with the campus, and a couple others. I hope, as summer makes it more and more intolerable to be inside, that I can set up a blanket outside in the shade next to a building with Wi-Fi and study that way.
						<br><br>Regardless, there are a couple essential points to the places I choose to study. The most essential one is <b>people in the surroundings</b>, which makes me feel accounted for. The second is
