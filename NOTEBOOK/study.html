<h1>HOW I STUDY</h1>

<p>I've found that in order for me to be productive, I must have a very strict, set list of things in order, or else, for some unknowable reason, i'm not able to study.</p>

<br>
</div>
<div id="body">
<h3 style="text-align:center;" id="currenthabits">IDEAL TIME</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"> Time or day and relation to other events is a crucial part of productivity.<br>Directly after I get home, I should make something to eat. This is my time to relax, and get the unproductive out, so to leave room for the productive.
<br>
After this, there comes to be 2 options - I either stay at home working at a comfortable pace, or I go somewhere to study and work hard. 
</p>

function myFunctionH() {
  var x = document.getElementById("myDIVH");
  if (x.style.display === "none") {
    x.style.display = "block";
  } else {
    x.style.display = "none";
  }
}
function myFunctionA() {
  var x = document.getElementById("myDIVA");
  if (x.style.display === "none") {
    x.style.display = "block";
  } else {
    x.style.display = "none";
  }
}
</script>

<p style="text-align:center;"><h4 style="text-align:center;" onclick="myFunctionH()" id="home"><b>AT HOME</b></h4></p>
	<div id="myDIVH">	
		<table class="table1">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td class="linkcol3" style="text-align:center;">
						When I am at home, I tend to stack off if I don't set up a <b>strict regimen</b> of what I am supposed to do and how I am supposed to do it. I have prepared a page in the back of my new <a href="../../../ABOUT/inventory.html#bag">Rocketbook</a> notebook where, to my ideal to-do list format, can plan out exactly what I must do and how much time I have to do it.
						 <br><br>If I have too quiet of a natural workspace (I.e., a space with no ambient sound, no TV in the background I can barely hear, etc.), I tend to try and fill the void with sound, via Youtube or music. To work at the optimal level, I must find a location with a decent, but not distracting, <b>ambient noise</b> level.
						 <br><br> When I work from home, my focus is optimized if I take a minute before the study session to <b>acknowledge why I want to achieve an learn and understand</b>. If I take a minute of my time to acknowledge these reasons, I become much more motivated to work.

	<div id="myDIVA">	
		<table class="table1">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td class="linkcol3" style="text-align:center;">
						Often, when I study at a location different from my home, it is either because of 1 of 2 reasons: either out of convenience, or out of necessity. Having to wear a <a href="https://www.gc2b.co">binder</a> any time I go out, I often try to minimize the times I put it back on and instead extend the one time I do wear it, if that makes sense.
						<br><br>The <b>location</b> where I study is pretty essential. I have a few locations I default to, and a few places I plan to take advantage of more often, given good weather. Some of those places include my local College study center ("the Dude"), Starbucks, Mighty Good Coffee, Local libraries associated with the campus, and a couple others.
						<br><br>Regardless, there are a couple essential points to the places I choose to study. The most essential one is <b>people in the surroundings</b>, which makes me feel accounted for. The second is, funnily enough, <b>availability of caffeine</b>. This is often the main factor, because it is the basis of the rest of the factors. The third factor is <b>friends</b>. While im in a focused mindset, i must write it out for myself later: I DO NOT WORK WELL WITH FRIENDS. DO NOT TRY TO STUDY WITH FRIENDS.
